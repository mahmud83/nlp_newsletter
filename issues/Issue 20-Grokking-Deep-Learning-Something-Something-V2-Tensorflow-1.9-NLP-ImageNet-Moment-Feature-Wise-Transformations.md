**Calls for Research…**
Ever wondered why Donald Trump and others use uppercase letters a lot on Twitter as reported [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/us/trump-capitalization-tweets-nyt.html)? I believe this can make a for an interesting NLP study, where we can analyze several accounts on Twitter and look for some linguistic patterns that can give us more clues to understand and explain this phenomenon. [Steven Pinker](https://twitter.com/sapinker) thinks capitalization is used to express irony but I believe it has to do with expressing emotion intensity and persuasion as well.

We have a come a long way with the NLP newsletter (We are on the 20th issue already 🙌). It’s worth a little celebration with emojis 🎉**🎉**🎉. These newsletters are certainly taking more time to prepare as the demand and supply of high quality information and news increases. I am very happy for the support and I hope to keep informing you with the latest and best NLP and AI news out there. You can also reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0) if you want to further discuss any of the items above.
