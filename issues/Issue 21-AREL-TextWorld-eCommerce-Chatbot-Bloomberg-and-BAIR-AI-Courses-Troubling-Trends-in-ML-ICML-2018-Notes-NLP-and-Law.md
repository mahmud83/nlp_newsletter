*Welcome to the 21st Issue of the NLP Newsletter! Here is this week’s notable NLP news! The best of ICML and ACL, new AI courses, lots of guides on things like evaluating feature importance and feasible human evaluation, story evaluation, reproducing deep learning papers, and much more.*

**On People…**  
A new paper presented in ICML 2018 describes some of the troubling trends in machine learning (ML) scholarship. The authors, Zachary C. Lipton and Jacob Steinhardt, discuss the implications of these trends on the field of ML and the proper distilling of machine learning research and ideas — [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341)

“NLP is allowing humans to interact with computers the same way they interact with themselves. It is also increasing the use of computers in our lives. Hence man-machine interface is not only changing, it’s importance is actually reducing” — [Link](http://www.businessworld.in/article/Natural-Language-Processing-Can-Change-The-Man-machine-Interface/15-07-2018-154607/)

In machine learning we rely a lot on human evaluation but how do we make it cheaper, here is a nice article explaining how this can be done — [Link](http://arun.chagantys.org/technical/2018/07/10/on-human-evaluation.html)
