*Great day and welcome to the 27th Issue of the NLP Newsletter! I am Elvis from Belize, Editor of* [*DAIR.ai*](https://medium.com/dair-ai)*, and a PhD researcher in AI and NLP. Here is this week’s notable NLP news: lots of QA tutorials and data releases; more on AI and health applications; unsupervised representation learning; fake news detection dataset; uncertainty in deep learning; and much more.*

**On People…**  
Several research institutions and startups, in collaboration with OpenAI, are building an AI that can *learn curiosity* without any guidance by only feeding it TV shows — [link](https://qz.com/1366484/give-ai-curiosity-and-it-will-watch-tv-forever/)

Perception Engines are a series of *machine vision algorithms* used to create different art prints that represent abstract shapes and the machines’ understanding of the world — [link](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17761424/ai-algorithm-art-machine-vision-perception-tom-white-treachery-imagenet)

Joel Grus shares his thoughts on why he doesn’t like notebooks for programming (slides) — [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/preview?slide=id.g362da58057_0_1)

According to new report, NLP and AI are being combined to help transform healthcare from physical interaction to high-quality clinical service free from physical co-location of the doctor. Essentially, NLP can be used to mine unstructured documents and make fast and efficient suggestions around clinical decision support — [link](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/319053)

Rwanda young technology entrepreneurs, together with the Rwanda ICT Chamber, are organizing a massive event dubbed “Building machine NLP for Kinyarwanda” to build NLP technology that can speak their language — [link](https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2018/08/23/rwandan-tech-enthusiasts-set-to-hold-event-on-natural-language-processing/)

**On Research…**  
A recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07371.pdf) presents a method for motion transfer using what’s called a “per-frame image-to-image translation with spatio-temporal smoothing”. The authors also created a demonstration that received huge attention on YouTube showing how professional dancing moves can be transferred to a target (amateur dancer) using pose detection — [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris&feature=youtu.be&t=2m13s)

Deep INFOMAX is a proposed method to learn unsupervised representations with the training objective to maximize mutual information between part or all of the input and a high-level feature vector. The idea is that representations should be learned from the information content or a structural constraint rather than all the bits at once — decision that matters at the semantic level — [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06670)

Volodymyr Kuleshov presents on the topic of estimating uncertainty in deep learning methods, which is crucial in many applications such as computer vision, healthcare, and robotics (slides) — [link](https://web.stanford.edu/~kuleshov/papers/uai2018-slides.pdf)
