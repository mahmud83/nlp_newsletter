*Hi and welcome to the 30th Issue of the NLP Newsletter! I am Elvis from Belize, Editor of* [*dair.ai*](https://medium.com/dair-ai)*, and a PhD researcher in AI and NLP. Here is this week’s notable NLP news: ethical machine learning; lots of NLP tutorials; GANs for art generation; NLP-based multitask learning; Reinforcement learning in multitask environments, and much more.*

**On People…**  
Last week I reported about a new hate speech [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00088.pdf). This week there is an article discussing how these type of online hate speech detectors can easily be tricked by humans — [link](https://phys.org/news/2018-09-detectors-online-speech-easily-duped.html)

In a candid talk delivered at the EmTech conference, AI researcher, Zachary Lipton discusses why he believes that AI has been over-hyped and how to promote a much healthier conversation around AI — [link](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612072/artificial-intelligence-is-often-overhypedand-heres-why-thats-dangerous/)

Researchers at MIT develop an AI system that is able to achieve human-like reasoning to evaluate images. The system relies on an “attention mask” which enables a visual understanding of how the model reasons in several sub tasks — [link](http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-lincoln-laboratory-ai-system-solves-problems-through-human-reasoning-0911)

New paper proposes a system called Textual Analogy Parsing (TAP) to model higher-order meaning based on a frame-style meaning representation. For instance, the technique is able to specify what is shared and what is compared between component facts — [link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/lamm2018analogies.pdf)

DeepMind develops a new technique called PopArt which enables a reinforcement learning agent to perform accurately in multitask environments — [link](https://deepmind.com/blog/preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets/)

Grammarly, a popular writing tool, set to gradually release a beta version of Chrome browser plugin that works with Google Docs. The company claims that they are leveraging NLP and AI to help people improve their writing — [link](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/grammarly-chrome-extension-google-docs/)
