Words embeddings are mostly used for text classification and solving other conventional NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. They could also be used for far more sophisticated systems such as building a *collaborative recommendation system* as reported in a recent blog post by [Sylvain Truong](https://towardsdatascience.com/@syltruong?source=post_header_lockup)(see figure for a preview of the framework) — [Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/collaborative-embeddings-for-lipstick-recommendations-98eccfa816bd)

**On Industry…**  
Facebook AI research team releases a new paper highlighting key findings on a method that dynamically selects the right types of embeddings for a specific task at hand. They call this concept *dynamic meta-embeddings* and it tends to outperform traditional word embedding on a variety of tasks — [Link](https://code.fb.com/ai-research/dynamic-meta-embeddings/)

On the topic of NLP, so far this year we have witnessed many breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing, starting from models that learn deep contextualized features ([ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)) to models that leverage fine-tuned language modeling techniques to efficiently perform downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis ([ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)). More recently, a new system has been proposed by Google AI Research team, called [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf), which basically tweaks the way *contextualized featured are learned in the Bi-LSTM layers* of a language representation model — [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)
